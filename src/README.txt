Bandicoot's real implementations are not in this directory, but in the include/ directory.
This is because Bandicoot can be used as a header-only library, and thus all implementations must be in headers.

This directory contains only the sources necessary to compile Bandicoot's "wrapper library", which eases the linking process.
