refactor to use axpy() calls for matrix addition
- this will only work for float, double ?
- cx_float, cx_double ?
- int, long ? use old method?

expand to handle cubes (aka "3d matrices", 3rd order tensors)


refactor to have an abstraction for various GPU BLAS backends,
so we are not directly tied to OpenCL;
follow similar approach as MAGMA ?
 - clBLAS  - opencl
 - clBlast - opencl
 - cuBLAS  - nvidia
